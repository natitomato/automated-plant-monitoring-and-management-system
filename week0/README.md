# Feasibility report : MiniProject 4th sem Team 10


## Project title :
Automated Plant Monitoring And Management System


## Motivation :
Automated plant monitor, maintaining and care-taking system with no external effort or
human interaction involved. A one-time instalment of portable greenery and mini biomes.
Problem statement :
Often we have avoided maintaining even a small garden as it requires maintenance and
constant care. To make this easy in the cities where plants are rapidly depleting, we plan on making
automated and self-monitoring mini biomes, which are aesthetic as well as easy to install anywhere
within our homes. Considering how people have to keep traveling or working away from their home
for long hours and will not be able to look after the plants, we intend to normalise biomes in cities
with various plants and smaller trees. Added to these, plants also die out even after much care and
attention due to the large number of variables involved that change rapidly like weather, humidity,
sunlight, rain and so on.

## Workflow
![workflow](https://github.com/natitomato/automated-plant-monitoring-and-management-system/blob/main/week0/workflow.png)


## Hardware and software

### Hardware
1. Arduino
2. Raspberry pi
3. Sensors

### Software
1. Python
2. Arduino
3. Android App / Web App
Workflow


## Deliverables :
The final product will result in 2 parts: the biome and an app. The biome itself will contain a
display that shows details about the biome itself in real time, such as temperature, humidity, light
intensity and so on. The app will tell the user about the schedule (time of watering, greenhouse, uv
light and so on) as well as the current details on the biome. End product with at least 2 weeks of
testing, and care-taking of any 1 indoor plant.
